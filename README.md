# File Handling Library

### Project Details
This is a repository implementing the standard file handling library in C.
* Functions implemented :
  * **fopen()**
  * **fclose()**
  * **fread()**
  * **fwrite()**
  * **fseek()**
  * **ftell()**
  * **fgetpos()**
  * **fsetpos()**
***

### Aim of the Project :
* The aim of project is to implement these pretty advanced file functions using the raw file functions: like open(), close(), read(), write() etc which operate on byte by byte basis using buffer.
* It also imvolves a set of exhaustive test-suites for these functions.

### Usage of the code :
* Pre-requisites : GCC or any other standard C compiler should be installed on the device.
* Compile : cc file.c -o file
* Execute : ./file
